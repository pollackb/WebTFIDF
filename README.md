# WebTFIDF
This script is meant to analyze web pages using TF-IDF to discover websites that
are similar in content. The use case for this script would be to determine if
there are mutiple web servers running the same application even if the content
is not 100% the same. the smaller the distance between two URLs the more likely
they contain similar content. Exact matches should result in a distance of 0.

## To Do:
